#&pi; Trainer

Congratulations on wanting to learn more digits of &pi;! An exciting journey awaits you.

##How to use the &pi; trainer

When you open up the &pi; trainer, you will be presented with a screen featuring the numeral three ("3") and a decimal point ("."). To the right of the decimal point is a shaded rectangle (representing the caret) and a number in the upper right-hand corner of the caret (displaying number of digits entered).

Go ahead and start typing! &pi; Trainer supports up to 100,000 digits of &pi;. If you make a mistake, the correct number will be displayed in place of the caret; you can also click on the caret to display the hint. If you want to start over, click on the digit counter.
