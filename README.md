#π Trainer

Congratulations on wanting to learn more digits of π! An exciting journey awaits you.

##How to use the π trainer

When you open up the π trainer, you will be presented with a screen featuring the numeral three ("3") and a decimal point ("."). To the right of the decimal point is a shaded rectangle (representing the caret) and a number in the upper right-hand corner of the caret (displaying number of digits entered).

Go ahead and start typing! π Trainer supports up to 10,000 digits of π. If you make a mistake, the correct number will be displayed in place of the caret; you can also click on the caret to display the hint. If you want to start over, click on the digit counter.

A copy of the pi trainer is running live at [http://pi.000a.biz/](http://pi.000a.biz/). Go ahead and check it out.
